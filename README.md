## About Me

Hello! I'm user https://www.twitch.tv/pluviocore 
I'm a common offline chatter you can probably find me there.
So we all know and love the SchnozeBot point system, it's a good way of tracking the most active people.
However:
   - It's all probability
   - Probability = 5Head Math

My main question is however:
   - Is it really probability?

I'm here to find that out.

I noticed a pattern;

If you roulette 1 point and win, you can usually roulette slightly more points and also win.

What I get from this:
 - There is a strategy to getting lots of points
 - There is a time period in which you will always win
Data I've collected:
 - [x] One Screenshot
 - [ ] Five Screenshots
 - [ ] At least 10 recorded test runs

Conclusion(s):
 - [ ] CLAIM IS CORRECT
 - [ ] CLAIM IS INCORRECT
 - [X] TO BE DETERMINED
