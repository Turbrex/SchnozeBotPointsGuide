## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm user https://www.twitch.tv/pluviocore 
I'm a common offline chatter you can probably find me there.
So we all know and love the SchnozeBot point system, it's a good way of tracking the most active people.
## INFO
###### However:
   - It's all probability
   - Probability = 5Head Math

###### BUT:
   - Is it really probability?

I'm here to find that out.

I noticed a pattern;

If you roulette 1 point and win, you can usually roulette slightly more points and also win.

###### What I get from this:
 - There is a strategy to getting lots of points
 - There is a time period in which you will always win
